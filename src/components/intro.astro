    The origins of FOSS go back to the 1950s. When the hardware was purchased,
    there used to be no additional charges for bundled software and the source
    code would also be available in order to fix possible bugs in the
    software.It was actually a common practice back then for users with the
    freedom to customize the code.At that time, primarily academicians and
    researchers in the industry were the collaborators to develop such
    software.The term Open Source was not there yet. Instead, the term that was
    popular at that time was “Public Domain Software”. As of today,
    ideologically, both are very much different in nature even though they may
    sound similar.Back in 1955, some users of the IBM 701 computer system from
    Los Angeles, voluntarily founded a group called SHARE. The “SHARE Program
    Library Agency” (SPLA) distributed information and software through magnetic
    tapes.Technical information shared, was about programming languages,
    operating systems, database systems, and user experiences for enterprise
    users of small, medium, and large-scale IBM computers.The initiative that is
    now more than 60 years old, continues to follow its goals quite actively.
    SHARE has its upcoming event coming up as SHARE Phoenix 2019
